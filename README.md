# Comparison Operators / Relational Operators
Decised the relationship between the operands. Result of comparision is a boolean value (True/ False)

# If, elsif, else
Simplest form of AI (you could say that)

'if' checks the condition, if true the intended blocks get executed, if false, it skips the intended blocks.

# pass
Does nothing, just ... passes... for now.

# Boolean Operators
AND, OR , NOT. operands need to be boolean as well. Output condition needs to be true or false
a = True 
B= False
result = a and b
print (result) would be Flase

Or 
a = True 
B= False
result = a or b
print (result) would be 

NOT
a = True 
B= False
result = a not b
print (result) would be True
